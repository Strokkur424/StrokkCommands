## What is StrokkCommands?
StrokkCommands is an **annotation-based command library**. You declare commands by using annotations (a.e. `@Command`)
on classes or methods. It was created for the [Paper](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper) server software, but
also works fine on its forks, unless they mess with the command system.

StrokkCommands has every natively available argument type implemented. All you need to, is add whichever
type you need to your command method and StrokkCommands will take care of the rest!

## What differentiates StrokkCommands from existing frameworks?
This is a very typical and often asked question. The primary difference is how lightweight it is.

Now, that's something basically all libraries say. But here I actually mean it. StrokkCommands
adds precisely **0 bytes** of library code to your plugin! **How is this possible?**, I hear you ask.

Well, StrokkCommands is an annotation **processor** based library, to be even more precise.
This means that by adding annotations to your code, the processor, which is a separate Java
program which automatically runs each time you build your project, **generates** all required
source files right inside your project (or more specifically, in a separate 'generated' sources root).

This effectively provides you with three advantages:
1. You have zero overhead compared to other (potentially reflection-based) library frameworks which might
   be abstracted away behind very complex structures.
2. You can look at the generated source and very easily see whether it fits what you had in mind, which also
   greatly improves the debuggability and doesn't hide everything behind library-internal logic.
3. Your commands are fully version-independent. As the generated code is based around Paper's exposed command API,
   there is close to no risk of updates to both Paper or StrokkCommands breaking the generated command.

## What are important design principles of StrokkCommands?
StrokkCommands takes care to do these things:

### No shading
You will never, ever have to shade anything into your plugin jar for it to work.

This has the advantage of being straightforward to set up, doesn't cause any
conflicts when two plugins have the same dependency, but different versions,
and keeps your plugin jar nice and light (the mentioned 0 bytes of library code).

### No reflection
**During runtime**, no reflection calls are performed. This results in some light limitations
with the visibility of certain classes/methods not being allowed to be private, but as they can be
package-private instead, this should rarely ever be a real issue.
